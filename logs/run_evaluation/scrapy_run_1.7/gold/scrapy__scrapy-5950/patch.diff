+Add-ons
+=======
+
+Scrapy's add-on system is a framework which unifies managing and configuring
+components that extend Scrapy's core functionality, such as middlewares,
+extensions, or pipelines. It provides users with a plug-and-play experience in
+Scrapy extension management, and grants extensive configuration control to
+developers.
+
+
+Activating and configuring add-ons
+==================================
+
+During :class:`~scrapy.crawler.Crawler` initialization, the list of enabled
+add-ons is read from your ``ADDONS`` setting.
+
+The ``ADDONS`` setting is a dict in which every key is an add-on class or its
+import path and the value is its priority.
+
+This is an example where two add-ons are enabled in a project's
+``settings.py``::
+
+    ADDONS = {
+        'path.to.someaddon': 0,
+        SomeAddonClass: 1,
+    }
+
+
+Writing your own add-ons
+========================
+
+Add-ons are Python classes that include the following method:
+
+.. method:: update_settings(settings)
+
+    This method is called during the initialization of the
+    :class:`~scrapy.crawler.Crawler`. Here, you should perform dependency checks
+    (e.g. for external Python libraries) and update the
+    :class:`~scrapy.settings.Settings` object as wished, e.g. enable components
+    for this add-on or set required configuration of other extensions.
+
+    :param settings: The settings object storing Scrapy/component configuration
+    :type settings: :class:`~scrapy.settings.Settings`
+
+They can also have the following method:
+
+.. classmethod:: from_crawler(cls, crawler)
+   :noindex:
+
+   If present, this class method is called to create an add-on instance
+   from a :class:`~scrapy.crawler.Crawler`. It must return a new instance
+   of the add-on. The crawler object provides access to all Scrapy core
+   components like settings and signals; it is a way for the add-on to access
+   them and hook its functionality into Scrapy.
+
+   :param crawler: The crawler that uses this add-on
+   :type crawler: :class:`~scrapy.crawler.Crawler`
+
+The settings set by the add-on should use the ``addon`` priority (see
+:ref:`populating-settings` and :func:`scrapy.settings.BaseSettings.set`)::
+
+    class MyAddon:
+        def update_settings(self, settings):
+            settings.set("DNSCACHE_ENABLED", True, "addon")
+
+This allows users to override these settings in the project or spider
+configuration. This is not possible with settings that are mutable objects,
+such as the dict that is a value of :setting:`ITEM_PIPELINES`. In these cases
+you can provide an add-on-specific setting that governs whether the add-on will
+modify :setting:`ITEM_PIPELINES`::
+
+    class MyAddon:
+        def update_settings(self, settings):
+            if settings.getbool("MYADDON_ENABLE_PIPELINE"):
+                settings["ITEM_PIPELINES"]["path.to.mypipeline"] = 200
+
+If the ``update_settings`` method raises
+:exc:`scrapy.exceptions.NotConfigured`, the add-on will be skipped. This makes
+it easy to enable an add-on only when some conditions are met.
+
+Fallbacks
+---------
+
+Some components provided by add-ons need to fall back to "default"
+implementations, e.g. a custom download handler needs to send the request that
+it doesn't handle via the default download handler, or a stats collector that
+includes some additional processing but otherwise uses the default stats
+collector. And it's possible that a project needs to use several custom
+components of the same type, e.g. two custom download handlers that support
+different kinds of custom requests and still need to use the default download
+handler for other requests. To make such use cases easier to configure, we
+recommend that such custom components should be written in the following way:
+
+1. The custom component (e.g. ``MyDownloadHandler``) shouldn't inherit from the
+   default Scrapy one (e.g.
+   ``scrapy.core.downloader.handlers.http.HTTPDownloadHandler``), but instead
+   be able to load the class of the fallback component from a special setting
+   (e.g. ``MY_FALLBACK_DOWNLOAD_HANDLER``), create an instance of it and use
+   it.
+2. The add-ons that include these components should read the current value of
+   the default setting (e.g. ``DOWNLOAD_HANDLERS``) in their
+   ``update_settings()`` methods, save that value into the fallback setting
+   (``MY_FALLBACK_DOWNLOAD_HANDLER`` mentioned earlier) and set the default
+   setting to the component provided by the add-on (e.g.
+   ``MyDownloadHandler``). If the fallback setting is already set by the user,
+   they shouldn't change it.
+3. This way, if there are several add-ons that want to modify the same setting,
+   all of them will fallback to the component from the previous one and then to
+   the Scrapy default. The order of that depends on the priority order in the
+   ``ADDONS`` setting.
+
+
+Add-on examples
+===============
+
+Set some basic configuration:
+
+.. code-block:: python
+
+    class MyAddon:
+        def update_settings(self, settings):
+            settings["ITEM_PIPELINES"]["path.to.mypipeline"] = 200
+            settings.set("DNSCACHE_ENABLED", True, "addon")
+
+Check dependencies:
+
+.. code-block:: python
+
+    class MyAddon:
+        def update_settings(self, settings):
+            try:
+                import boto
+            except ImportError:
+                raise NotConfigured("MyAddon requires the boto library")
+            ...
+
+Access the crawler instance:
+
+.. code-block:: python
+
+    class MyAddon:
+        def __init__(self, crawler) -> None:
+            super().__init__()
+            self.crawler = crawler
+
+        @classmethod
+        def from_crawler(cls, crawler):
+            return cls(crawler)
+
+        def update_settings(self, settings):
+            ...
+
+Use a fallback component:
+
+.. code-block:: python
+
+    from scrapy.core.downloader.handlers.http import HTTPDownloadHandler
+
+
+    FALLBACK_SETTING = "MY_FALLBACK_DOWNLOAD_HANDLER"
+
+
+    class MyHandler:
+        lazy = False
+
+        def __init__(self, settings, crawler):
+            dhcls = load_object(settings.get(FALLBACK_SETTING))
+            self._fallback_handler = create_instance(
+                dhcls,
+                settings=None,
+                crawler=crawler,
+            )
+
+        def download_request(self, request, spider):
+            if request.meta.get("my_params"):
+                # handle the request
+                ...
+            else:
+                return self._fallback_handler.download_request(request, spider)
+
+
+    class MyAddon:
+        def update_settings(self, settings):
+            if not settings.get(FALLBACK_SETTING):
+                settings.set(
+                    FALLBACK_SETTING,
+                    settings.getwithbase("DOWNLOAD_HANDLERS")["https"],
+                    "addon",
+                )

-=======  ===================
-SEP      21
-Title    Add-ons
-Author   Pablo Hoffman
-Created  2014-02-14
-Status   Draft
-=======  ===================
-
-================
-SEP-021: Add-ons
-================
-
-This proposal introduces add-ons, a unified way to manage Scrapy extensions,
-middlewares and pipelines.
-
-Scrapy currently supports many hooks and mechanisms for extending its
-functionality, but no single entry point for enabling and configuring them.
-Instead, the hooks are spread over:
-
-* Spider middlewares (SPIDER_MIDDLEWARES)
-* Downloader middlewares (DOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES)
-* Downloader handlers (DOWNLOADER_HANDLERS)
-* Item pipelines (ITEM_PIPELINES)
-* Feed exporters and storages (FEED_EXPORTERS, FEED_STORAGES)
-* Overridable components (DUPEFILTER_CLASS, STATS_CLASS, SCHEDULER, SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS, ITEM_PROCESSOR, etc)
-* Generic extensions (EXTENSIONS)
-* CLI commands (COMMANDS_MODULE)
-
-One problem of this approach is that enabling an extension often requires
-modifying many settings, often in a coordinated way, which is complex and error
-prone. Add-ons are meant to fix this by providing a simple mechanism for
-enabling extensions.
-
-Design goals and non-goals
-==========================
-
-Goals:
-
-* simple to manage: adding or removing extensions should be just a matter of
-  adding or removing lines in a ``scrapy.cfg`` file
-* backward compatibility with enabling extension the "old way" (i.e. modifying
-  settings directly)
-
-Non-goals:
-
-* a way to publish, distribute or discover extensions (use pypi for that)
-
-
-Managing add-ons
-================
-
-Add-ons are defined in the ``scrapy.cfg`` file, inside the ``[addons]``
-section.
-
-To enable the "httpcache" addon, either shipped with Scrapy or in the Python
-search path, create an entry for it in your ``scrapy.cfg``, like this::
-
-    [addons]
-    httpcache = 
-
-You may also specify the full path to an add-on (which may be either a .py file
-or a folder containing __init__.py)::
-
-    [addons]
-    mongodb_pipeline = /path/to/mongodb_pipeline.py
-
-
-Writing add-ons
-===============
-
-Add-ons are Python modules that implement the following callbacks.
-
-addon_configure
----------------
-
-Receives the Settings object and modifies it to enable the required components.
-If it raises an exception, Scrapy will print it and exit.
-
-Examples:
-
-.. code-block:: python
-
-    def addon_configure(settings):
-        settings.overrides["DOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES"].update(
-            {
-                "scrapy.contrib.downloadermiddleware.httpcache.HttpCacheMiddleware": 900,
-            }
-        )
-
-.. code-block:: python
-
-    def addon_configure(settings):
-        try:
-            import boto
-        except ImportError:
-            raise RuntimeError("boto library is required")
-
-
-crawler_ready
--------------
-
-``crawler_ready`` receives a Crawler object after it has been initialized and
-is meant to be used to perform post-initialization checks like making sure the
-extension and its dependencies were configured properly. If it raises an
-exception, Scrapy will print and exit.
-
-Examples:
-
-.. code-block:: python
-
-    def crawler_ready(crawler):
-        if "some.other.addon" not in crawler.extensions.enabled:
-            raise RuntimeError("Some other addon is required to use this addon")
